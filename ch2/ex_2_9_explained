I'm not going to write a new version of bitcount because I don't think it's
worth my time.
To answer the question; In a two's complement number system x &= (x-1) deletes
the rightmost bit a follows:
-The expression x - 1 causes the rightmost bit with a 1 value to have it's 
value distributed across the lower bits and decremented by 1.
-The AND operator cancels out any value the lower bits held, as the actual x 
value still has zero values in these bits.
-The assignment operator assigns the result of this operation to x, removing the
rightmost 1 bit.
